    "<p style=\"font-family: verdana\">In botanics, <b>pruning</b> is a method that's involved with removing the unwanted or unnecessary parts of a tree, branch or plant.

This is called <b>decision tree pruning</b>.</p>\n",

    "<p style=\"font-family: verdana\"><b>Twigs</b> are the nodes whose children nodes are all leaves. We need to prune these twigs to prevent overfitting in our decision tree. The twigs to be pruned will also be decided by our ID3 algorithm. We'll keep track of all twigs in our decision tree. Then we'll find the twig with the least information gain (the attribute that's farthest from the root node and has all leaves as children), decide <b>which decision has more nodes as the twig's children</b> and replace the twig with the majority decision, so it will be a leaf in our decision tree. Finally, we'll calculate the pruned tree's accuracy and compare it with the unpruned tree's accuracy. If our new tree is <b>equally or more accurate</b> then the previous one, we'll calculate the next twig in our pruned decision tree. We'll keep calculating twigs <b>until the new tree is less accurate than the previous tree</b>. In such case, we must revert the twig calculation operations for that tree and terminate the twig finding process for the tree.</p>"

    "<p style=\"font-family: verdana\">Pre-pruning moves more quickly than post-pruning does. This is crucial when post-pruning must analyze a huge subset of trees on larger datasets (either with more features or data). Pre-pruning occasionally yields outcomes that are comparable to or superior than those of post-pruning. Pre-pruning is greedy and may disregard splits that have future significant splits, which typically leads to a worse tree than post-pruning.</p>\n",

The primary distinction between the two models is the addition of attritions in place of the low-gain twigs, which in the previous model were limited to leaf nodes. This example demonstrates that while more accuracy can occasionally be acquired from the model, it is not always the case. Preventing overfitting is the main motivation for this procedure for us. For this, branches that might lead to overfitting are cut, and the model is continuously updated using the validation dataset. It is then put to the test using the test dataset. For better results, the dataset might be expanded in addition to being pruned. With a bigger and more varied data collection, accuracy might be improved.</p>"
